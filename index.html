  <h1>Create More</h1>
  <h2>Hi, I'm Lex!</h2>
  <p> I love to create new things in the world and to help the creators of this world. </p>
  <p>My love of creation has come in many forms. 
  </p>
  <p>Unfortunately, tales of successful people rarely talk about the sheer amount of knowledge needed to accomplish a thing well. </p>
  <p>We love stories about amazing feats like the first climb to Mt. Everest. </p>
  <p>Or…</p>
  <p>Documentaries about stand-out business leaders, artists, and creators. We're drawn to those stories because they show us the way.
  </p>
  <p>Ways we never would have imagined.</p>
  <h1>Create Often</h1>
  <p>Your focus is your superpower. Take charge by delegating the positions that you prefer not to do. </p>
  <p>I firmly believe that the more you lean into your passion, the better the success.</p>
  <p>Your goal is to climb this mountain top, and I'm your creative sherpa. </p>
  <h1>Create 
    for self</h1>
    <p>My passion isn't just a 9-5 thing, a coding thing, or a design thing. </p>
    <p>My passion for creation is unbound.</p>
    <p>I'm inquisitive, and if you have something that sounds difficult to describe or you need to explain your passion to those in other fields, you've reached the right place. </p>
    <p>I've made it a point to learn about and study across platforms so I can make the needed connections to present in a meaningful way.</p>
    <h1>Create for the world</h1>
    <p>Whether you have created a business, brought an idea to the world, or have a gift to share, I want to help you reach those goals. Help you connect with your tribe and let people see what you have to share. Let us go to the top of the mountain together.</p>
